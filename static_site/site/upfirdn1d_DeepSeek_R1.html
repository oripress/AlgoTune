YOUR TASK:
Your objective is to define a class named `Solver` in `solver.py` with a method:
```
class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -&gt; Any:
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Your implementation goes here.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        ...
```

IMPORTANT: Compilation time of your init function will not count towards your function&#x27;s runtime.

This `solve` function will be the entrypoint called by the evaluation harness. Strive to align your class and method implementation as closely as possible with the desired performance criteria.
For each instance, your function can run for at most 10x the reference runtime for that instance. Strive to have your implementation run as fast as possible, while returning the same output as the reference function (for the same given input). Be creative and optimize your approach!

Your messages should include a short thought about what you should do, followed by a _SINGLE_ command. The command must be enclosed within ``` and ```, like so:
&lt;Reasoning behind executing the command&gt;
```
&lt;command&gt;
```

IMPORTANT: Each set of triple backticks (```) must always be on their own line, without any other words or anything else on that line.

Here are the commands available to you. Ensure you include one and only one of the following commands in each of your responses:
- `edit`: Replace a range of lines with new content in a file. This is how you can create files: if the file does not exist, it will be created. Here is an example:
  ```
  edit 
  file: &lt;file_name&gt;
  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;
  ---
  &lt;new_content&gt;
  ---
  ```

  The command will:
  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)
  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;
  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file
  
  Example:
  edit
  file: solver.py
  lines: 5-7
  ---
  def improved_function():
      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)
  ---
- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.
- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).
- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.
- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: 
  ```
  reference [1,2,3,4]
  ```
- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: 
  ```
  eval_input [1,2,3,4]
  ```
- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.
- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:
  ```
  delete
  file: &lt;file_name&gt;
  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;

  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)
  
  Example:
  delete
  file: solver.py
  lines: 5-10
  ```
- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.
  Example:
  ```
  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]
  ```

- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.
  Example: 
  ```
  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]
  ```

**TIPS:**
After each edit, a linter will automatically run to ensure code quality. If there are critical linter errors, your changes will not be applied, and you will receive the linter&#x27;s error message. Typically, linter errors arise from issues like improper indentation—ensure your edits maintain proper code formatting.
**Cython Compilation:** Edits creating or modifying Cython (`.pyx`) files will automatically trigger a compilation attempt (requires a `setup.py`). You will be notified if compilation succeeds or fails. If it fails, the edit to the `.pyx` file will be automatically reverted.
If the code runs successfully without errors, the in-memory &#x27;last known good code&#x27; will be updated to the new version. Following successful edits, you will receive a summary of your `solve` function&#x27;s performance compared to the reference.
If you get stuck, try reverting your code and restarting your train of thought.
Do not put an if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: block in your code, as it will not be ran (only the solve function will).
Keep trying to better your code until you run out of money. Do not stop beforehand!

**GOALS:**
Your primary objective is to optimize the `solve` function to run as as fast as possible, while returning the optimal solution.
You will receive better scores the quicker your solution runs, and you will be penalized for exceeding the time limit or returning non-optimal solutions.

Below you find the description of the task you will have to solve. Read it carefully and understand what the problem is and what your solver should do.

**TASK DESCRIPTION:**
upfirdn1d

Given a filter h and an input signal x, the task is to perform upsampling, FIR filtering, and downsampling in one step.
The upsampling factor and downsampling factor are provided as parameters.
The operation applies the filter to the upsampled signal and then downsamples the result.
The output is a 1D array representing the filtered and resampled signal.

Input:
A tuple of two 1D arrays.

Example input:
([0.2, -0.1, 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, -0.2, 0.1, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0, 17.0, 18.0, 19.0, 20.0, 21.0, 22.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, 27.0, 28.0, 29.0, 30.0, 31.0])

Output:
A 1D array representing the upfirdn result.

Example output:
[0.25, 0.75, 1.50, 2.00, 2.75, 3.25, 4.00, 4.50, 5.25, 5.75, 6.50, 7.00, 7.75, 8.25, 9.00, 9.50, 10.25, 10.75, 11.50, 12.00, 12.75, 13.25, 14.00, 14.50, 15.25, 15.75, 16.50, 17.00, 17.75, 18.25, 19.00, 19.50, 20.25, 20.75, 21.50, 22.00, 22.75, 23.25]

Below is the reference implementation. Your function should run much quicker.

                The profiling results show that most time is spent in the `upfirdn` function itself. Since we&#x27;re already parallelizing across problems, we need to optimize the core computation. Let&#x27;s try using Numba to JIT-compile the upfirdn operation for significant speedups. We&#x27;ll implement a custom Numba-accelerated version:<br><br><pre><code class="language-python">edit

Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.<br>  Example: <br>  ```<br>  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.<br>  Example: <br>  ```<br>  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```

This is how you can create files: if the file does not exist, it will be created. Here is an example:<br>  ```<br>  edit <br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br>  ---<br>  &lt;new_content&gt;<br>  ---<br>  ```<br><br>  The command will:<br>  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input.

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3.

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

Ensure you include one and only one of the following commands in each of your responses:<br>- `edit`: Replace a range of lines with new content in a file. This is how you can create files: if the file does not exist, it will be created. Here is an example:<br>  ```<br>  edit <br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br>  ---<br>  &lt;new_content&gt;<br>  ---<br>  ```<br><br>  The command will:<br>  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input.

Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3.

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

Important: remember to include all arguments for each command.<br>Remember to sandwich your command in between ``` and ```. <br>IMPORTANT: Each set of triple backticks (```) must always be on their own line, without any other words or anything else on that line.<br><br>Here are the commands available to you. Ensure you include one and only one of the following commands in each of your responses:<br>- `edit`: Replace a range of lines with new content in a file. This is how you can create files: if the file does not exist, it will be created. Here is an example:<br>  ```<br>  edit <br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br>  ---<br>  &lt;new_content&gt;<br>  ---<br>  ```<br><br>  The command will:<br>  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.<br>  Example: <br>  ```<br>  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```

                The evaluation shows that our parallel implementation didn&#x27;t provide any speedup over the reference solution. This suggests that the overhead of thread management might be canceling out any parallelization benefits.

                The shape mismatch errors indicate our Numba implementation doesn&#x27;t match Scipy&#x27;s output length calculation. After reviewing Scipy&#x27;s source code, I discovered that the output length formula should be:<br>`n_out = (len(x) * up + len(h) - 1) // down`<br>which is what we&#x27;re already using. However, the issue might be with boundary conditions. Let&#x27;s revert to Scipy&#x27;s implementation and optimize it with parallel processing using ProcessPoolExecutor to handle multiple problems concurrently.<br><br><pre><code class="language-python">edit

                You have sent 121 messages and have used up $0.5013. You have $0.4987 remaining.<br><br>Command parsing failed. <br>Remember to include one and only one command in each message. Important: remember to include all arguments for each command.<br>Remember to sandwich your command in between ``` and ```. <br>IMPORTANT: Each set of triple backticks (```) must always be on their own line, without any other words or anything else on that line.<br><br>Here are the commands available to you. Ensure you include one and only one of the following commands in each of your responses:<br>- `edit`: Replace a range of lines with new content in a file. This is how you can create files: if the file does not exist, it will be created. Here is an example:<br>  ```<br>  edit <br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br>  ---<br>  &lt;new_content&gt;<br>  ---<br>  ```<br><br>  The command will:<br>  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.<br>  Example: <br>  ```<br>  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```

                You have sent 140 messages and have used up $0.6540. You have $0.3460 remaining.<br><br>Command parsing failed. <br>Remember to include one and only one command in each message. Important: remember to include all arguments for each command.<br>Remember to sandwich your command in between ``` and ```. <br>IMPORTANT: Each set of triple backticks (```) must always be on their own line, without any other words or anything else on that line.<br><br>Here are the commands available to you. Ensure you include one and only one of the following commands in each of your responses:<br>- `edit`: Replace a range of lines with new content in a file. This is how you can create files: if the file does not exist, it will be created. Here is an example:<br>  ```<br>  edit <br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br>  ---<br>  &lt;new_content&gt;<br>  ---<br>  ```<br><br>  The command will:<br>  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.<br>  Example: <br>  ```<br>  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```

                The threading approach has improved performance to 78% valid solutions with 22% timeouts. To further optimize, I&#x27;ll implement a hybrid approach that combines threading with optimized memory usage. The key changes are:<br>1. Precompute all problem complexities to optimize thread allocation<br>2. Use a priority queue to process large problems first<br>3. Add a timeout mechanism for individual problem processing<br><br><pre><code class="language-python">edit

Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input.

Ensure you include one and only one of the following commands in each of your responses:<br>- `edit`: Replace a range of lines with new content in a file. This is how you can create files: if the file does not exist, it will be created. Here is an example:<br>  ```<br>  edit <br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br>  ---<br>  &lt;new_content&gt;<br>  ---<br>  ```<br><br>  The command will:<br>  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input.

If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input.

Here is an example:<br>  ```<br>  edit <br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br>  ---<br>  &lt;new_content&gt;<br>  ---<br>  ```<br><br>  The command will:<br>  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.<br>  Example: <br>  ```<br>  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```
