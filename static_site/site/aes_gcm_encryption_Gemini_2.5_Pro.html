You&#x27;re an autonomous programmer tasked with solving a specific problem. You are to use the commands defined below to accomplish this task. Every message you send incurs a cost—you will be informed of your usage and remaining budget by the system.
You will be evaluated based on the best-performing piece of code you produce, even if the final code doesn&#x27;t work or compile (as long as it worked at some point and achieved a score, you will be eligible).
Apart from the default Python packages, you have access to the following additional packages:
 - cryptography
 - cvxpy
 - cython
 - dace
 - dask
 - diffrax
 - ecos
 - faiss-cpu
 - hdbscan
 - highspy
 - jax
 - networkx
 - numba
 - numpy
 - ortools
 - pandas
 - pot
 - psutil
 - pulp
 - pyomo
 - python-sat
 - pythran
 - scikit-learn
 - scipy
 - sympy

Your objective is to define a class named `Solver` in `solver.py` with a method:
```
class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -&gt; Any:
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Your implementation goes here.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        ...
```

IMPORTANT: Compilation time of your init function will not count towards your function&#x27;s runtime.

This `solve` function will be the entrypoint called by the evaluation harness. Strive to align your class and method implementation as closely as possible with the desired performance criteria.
For each instance, your function can run for at most 10x the reference runtime for that instance. Strive to have your implementation run as fast as possible, while returning the same output as the reference function (for the same given input). Be creative and optimize your approach!

Your messages should include a short thought about what you should do, followed by a _SINGLE_ command. The command must be enclosed within ``` and ```, like so:
&lt;Reasoning behind executing the command&gt;
```
&lt;command&gt;
```

IMPORTANT: Each set of triple backticks (```) must always be on their own line, without any other words or anything else on that line.

Here are the commands available to you. Ensure you include one and only one of the following commands in each of your responses:
- `edit`: Replace a range of lines with new content in a file. This is how you can create files: if the file does not exist, it will be created. Here is an example:
  ```
  edit 
  file: &lt;file_name&gt;
  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;
  ---
  &lt;new_content&gt;
  ---
  ```

  The command will:
  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)
  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;
  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file
  
  Example:
  edit
  file: solver.py
  lines: 5-7
  ---
  def improved_function():
      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)
  ---
- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.
- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).
- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.
- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: 
  ```
  reference [1,2,3,4]
  ```
- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: 
  ```
  eval_input [1,2,3,4]
  ```
- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.
- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:
  ```
  delete
  file: &lt;file_name&gt;
  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;

  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)
  
  Example:
  delete
  file: solver.py
  lines: 5-10
  ```
- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.
  Example:
  ```
  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]
  ```

- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.
  Example: 
  ```
  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]
  ```

**TIPS:**
After each edit, a linter will automatically run to ensure code quality. If there are critical linter errors, your changes will not be applied, and you will receive the linter&#x27;s error message. Typically, linter errors arise from issues like improper indentation—ensure your edits maintain proper code formatting.
**Cython Compilation:** Edits creating or modifying Cython (`.pyx`) files will automatically trigger a compilation attempt (requires a `setup.py`). You will be notified if compilation succeeds or fails. If it fails, the edit to the `.pyx` file will be automatically reverted.
If the code runs successfully without errors, the in-memory &#x27;last known good code&#x27; will be updated to the new version. Following successful edits, you will receive a summary of your `solve` function&#x27;s performance compared to the reference.
If you get stuck, try reverting your code and restarting your train of thought.
Do not put an if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: block in your code, as it will not be ran (only the solve function will).
Keep trying to better your code until you run out of money. Do not stop beforehand!

**GOALS:**
Your primary objective is to optimize the `solve` function to run as as fast as possible, while returning the optimal solution.
You will receive better scores the quicker your solution runs, and you will be penalized for exceeding the time limit or returning non-optimal solutions.

Below you find the description of the task you will have to solve. Read it carefully and understand what the problem is and what your solver should do.

**TASK DESCRIPTION:**
AesGcmEncryption Task:

Task Description:
Encrypt a given plaintext using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) with a provided key, nonce (Initialization Vector - IV), and optional associated data (AAD). This task uses `cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.AESGCM`. AES-GCM provides both confidentiality and data authenticity. The primary computational cost scales with the length of the plaintext.

Input:
A dictionary with keys:
  - &quot;key&quot;: A bytes object representing the AES key (e.g., 16, 24, or 32 bytes for AES-128, AES-192, AES-256).
  - &quot;nonce&quot;: A bytes object representing the nonce (IV). For GCM, 12 bytes is commonly recommended. Must be unique for each encryption with the same key.
  - &quot;plaintext&quot;: A bytes object representing the data to encrypt. The size of this data will scale with the problem size &#x27;n&#x27;.
  - &quot;associated_data&quot;: A bytes object representing additional data to authenticate but not encrypt (optional, can be `None` or empty bytes `b&#x27;&#x27;`).

Example input:
{
    &quot;key&quot;: b&#x27;\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f\x10&#x27;, # 16 bytes key for AES-128
    &quot;nonce&quot;: b&#x27;\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b&#x27;, # 12 bytes nonce
    &quot;plaintext&quot;: b&#x27;data to encrypt&#x27; * 100, # Example scaled plaintext
    &quot;associated_data&quot;: b&#x27;metadata&#x27;
}

Output:
A dictionary containing:
  - &quot;ciphertext&quot;: A bytes object representing the encrypted data.
  - &quot;tag&quot;: A bytes object representing the GCM authentication tag (typically 16 bytes).

Example output:
# The actual output depends on the exact inputs (key, nonce, plaintext, aad).
# This is a conceptual placeholder.
{
    &quot;ciphertext&quot;: b&#x27;\xencrypted...\data&#x27;,
    &quot;tag&quot;: b&#x27;\xauthentication-tag&#x27; # 16 bytes
}

It also makes the code cleaner by separating the caching logic from the main `solve` method. I&#x27;ll set a `maxsize` for the cache to make it more robust against high memory usage in scenarios with a large number of unique keys.<br><br><pre><code class="language-python">edit

There are no further significant optimization opportunities in the Python code. I am confident this is a near-optimal solution.<br><br><pre><code class="language-python">eval</code></pre>

                An analysis of the initial `solver.py` reveals a significant performance bottleneck. The line `aesgcm = AESGCM(key)` is executed on every call to the `solve` method.

Since the evaluation environment reuses the same `Solver` instance for multiple calls, and the input data may reuse the same encryption keys, this setup process is performed unnecessarily for repeated keys.<br><br>My optimization strategy is to cache the initialized `AESGCM` objects.

I will create a static helper method, `_get_cipher(key)`, which will be responsible for creating `AESGCM` objects.

If one exists, it&#x27;s returned instantly. If not, a new `AESGCM` object is created, stored in the cache, and then returned.<br><br>This approach is superior to a manual dictionary-based cache because it is cleaner, more idiomatic, and robust.

                The 1.22x speedup from caching the `AESGCM` object is a good start, but the evaluation message strongly suggests that a more fundamental change is needed to achieve a top-tier performance. My current approach optimizes for key reuse, but its effectiveness is limited by the actual data pattern in the evaluation.<br><br>The hint to &quot;think outside the box&quot; and &quot;use all available packages&quot; points towards trying a different underlying cryptographic library. The `cryptography` library is standard, but `PyCryptodome` is a popular alternative often lauded for its performance.<br><br>The key difference in API is that `PyCryptodome`&#x27;s `AES.new()` binds the nonce at initialization, which prevents the caching strategy I previously used. However, it&#x27;s possible that `PyCryptodome`&#x27;s raw performance for key setup and encryption is so much faster that it outperforms a cached solution using the `cryptography` library, especially if key reuse in the test set is not extremely high.<br><br>I will now replace the `cryptography`-based solution with one using `PyCryptodome`. This is a calculated risk: if the library isn&#x27;t available, it will fail. But given the prompt, it&#x27;s the most logical next step to find a significant performance leap.<br><br><pre><code class="language-python">edit

                The adaptive strategy resulted in a 1.14x speedup, which is worse than my previous best of 1.24x. This is a critical piece of information. It strongly implies that the `PyCryptodome` library (`from Crypto.Cipher import AES`) *is* available in the evaluation environment, but my implementation using it is slower than my optimized `cryptography`-based solution.<br><br>This happens because `PyCryptodome`&#x27;s API requires re-initializing the cipher with the nonce for every operation, preventing the caching of the expensive key setup. My `cryptography`-based solution with a class-level cache excels precisely because the test data must feature significant key reuse, making the cache highly effective.<br><br>The &quot;think outside the box&quot; hint led me to try a different library, but the data shows this was a performance regression for this specific problem. The true path to optimization lies in perfecting the caching strategy with the `cryptography` library.<br><br>My experiments showed:<br>- `lru_cache(maxsize=128)`: 1.22x speedup<br>- `lru_cache(maxsize=None)`: 0.95x speedup (slower)<br>- Manual class dictionary: 1.24x speedup<br><br>The slowdown with an unbounded cache suggests there&#x27;s an optimal cache size that&#x27;s larger than 128 but not infinite. The overhead of managing a very large or unbounded cache is hurting performance. I will revert to the `lru_cache` implementation, which is written in C and highly optimized, but I will increase its size.

                The micro-optimization of using a local variable for the cache did not yield any improvement, indicating that attribute lookup is not the bottleneck.

By subclassing `dict` and implementing the `__missing__` method, the logic for handling cache misses is moved into a dedicated method that is called automatically by the dictionary itself. This approach is often cleaner and can be more performant as it avoids the overhead associated with setting up a `try...except` block for every single call, which can be beneficial when cache hits are the common case.<br><br>I will now refactor my best-performing solution to use this `__missing__` pattern.

A class-level dictionary (`_cipher_cache: Dict[bytes, AESGCM] = {}`) proved to be the best implementation for this cache.

Since then, the environment has been unable to execute *any* code, including the original baseline and the previously successful optimized version.<br><br>**Conclusion:**<br><br>I have developed and validated a correct and effective optimization. However, due to a persistent and unrecoverable error within the evaluation environment itself, I am unable to submit my solution or make further progress. The problem is no longer solvable with the available tools.<br><br>As I am required to issue a command, I will make one final, futile attempt to evaluate the code.<br><br><pre><code class="language-python">eval</code></pre>
