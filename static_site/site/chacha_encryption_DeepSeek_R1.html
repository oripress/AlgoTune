You&#x27;re an autonomous programmer tasked with solving a specific problem. You are to use the commands defined below to accomplish this task. Every message you send incurs a cost—you will be informed of your usage and remaining budget by the system.
You will be evaluated based on the best-performing piece of code you produce, even if the final code doesn&#x27;t work or compile (as long as it worked at some point and achieved a score, you will be eligible).
Apart from the default Python packages, you have access to the following additional packages:
 - cryptography
 - cvxpy
 - cython
 - dace
 - dask
 - diffrax
 - ecos
 - faiss-cpu
 - hdbscan
 - highspy
 - jax
 - networkx
 - numba
 - numpy
 - ortools
 - pandas
 - pot
 - psutil
 - pulp
 - pyomo
 - python-sat
 - pythran
 - scikit-learn
 - scipy
 - sympy

Your objective is to define a class named `Solver` in `solver.py` with a method:
```
class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -&gt; Any:
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Your implementation goes here.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        ...
```

IMPORTANT: Compilation time of your init function will not count towards your function&#x27;s runtime.

This `solve` function will be the entrypoint called by the evaluation harness. Strive to align your class and method implementation as closely as possible with the desired performance criteria.
For each instance, your function can run for at most 10x the reference runtime for that instance. Strive to have your implementation run as fast as possible, while returning the same output as the reference function (for the same given input). Be creative and optimize your approach!

Your messages should include a short thought about what you should do, followed by a _SINGLE_ command. The command must be enclosed within ``` and ```, like so:
&lt;Reasoning behind executing the command&gt;
```
&lt;command&gt;
```

IMPORTANT: Each set of triple backticks (```) must always be on their own line, without any other words or anything else on that line.

Here are the commands available to you. Ensure you include one and only one of the following commands in each of your responses:
- `edit`: Replace a range of lines with new content in a file. This is how you can create files: if the file does not exist, it will be created. Here is an example:
  ```
  edit 
  file: &lt;file_name&gt;
  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;
  ---
  &lt;new_content&gt;
  ---
  ```

  The command will:
  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)
  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;
  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file
  
  Example:
  edit
  file: solver.py
  lines: 5-7
  ---
  def improved_function():
      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)
  ---
- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.
- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).
- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.
- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: 
  ```
  reference [1,2,3,4]
  ```
- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: 
  ```
  eval_input [1,2,3,4]
  ```
- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.
- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:
  ```
  delete
  file: &lt;file_name&gt;
  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;

  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)
  
  Example:
  delete
  file: solver.py
  lines: 5-10
  ```
- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.
  Example:
  ```
  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]
  ```

- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.
  Example: 
  ```
  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]
  ```

**TIPS:**
After each edit, a linter will automatically run to ensure code quality. If there are critical linter errors, your changes will not be applied, and you will receive the linter&#x27;s error message. Typically, linter errors arise from issues like improper indentation—ensure your edits maintain proper code formatting.
**Cython Compilation:** Edits creating or modifying Cython (`.pyx`) files will automatically trigger a compilation attempt (requires a `setup.py`). You will be notified if compilation succeeds or fails. If it fails, the edit to the `.pyx` file will be automatically reverted.
If the code runs successfully without errors, the in-memory &#x27;last known good code&#x27; will be updated to the new version. Following successful edits, you will receive a summary of your `solve` function&#x27;s performance compared to the reference.
If you get stuck, try reverting your code and restarting your train of thought.
Do not put an if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: block in your code, as it will not be ran (only the solve function will).
Keep trying to better your code until you run out of money. Do not stop beforehand!

**GOALS:**
Your primary objective is to optimize the `solve` function to run as as fast as possible, while returning the optimal solution.
You will receive better scores the quicker your solution runs, and you will be penalized for exceeding the time limit or returning non-optimal solutions.

Below you find the description of the task you will have to solve. Read it carefully and understand what the problem is and what your solver should do.

**TASK DESCRIPTION:**
ChaChaEncryption Task:

Task Description:
Encrypt a given plaintext using ChaCha20-Poly1305 with a provided key, nonce, and optional associated data (AAD). This task uses `cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.ChaCha20Poly1305`. ChaCha20-Poly1305 is a modern AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) cipher that provides both confidentiality and data authenticity. The primary computational cost scales with the length of the plaintext.

Input:
A dictionary with keys:
  - &quot;key&quot;: A bytes object representing the ChaCha20 key (32 bytes for 256-bit key).
  - &quot;nonce&quot;: A bytes object representing the nonce. For ChaCha20-Poly1305, 12 bytes (96 bits) is required. Must be unique for each encryption with the same key.
  - &quot;plaintext&quot;: A bytes object representing the data to encrypt. The size of this data will scale with the problem size &#x27;n&#x27;.
  - &quot;associated_data&quot;: A bytes object representing additional data to authenticate but not encrypt (optional, can be `None` or empty bytes `b&#x27;&#x27;`).

Example input:
{
    &quot;key&quot;: b&#x27;\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f\x10&#x27;, # 16 bytes key for AES-128
    &quot;nonce&quot;: b&#x27;\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b&#x27;, # 12 bytes nonce
    &quot;plaintext&quot;: b&#x27;data to encrypt&#x27; * 100, # Example scaled plaintext
    &quot;associated_data&quot;: b&#x27;metadata&#x27;
}

Output:
A dictionary containing:
  - &quot;ciphertext&quot;: A bytes object representing the encrypted data.
  - &quot;tag&quot;: A bytes object representing the Poly1305 authentication tag (16 bytes).

Example output:
# The actual output depends on the exact inputs (key, nonce, plaintext, aad).
# This is a conceptual placeholder.
{
    &quot;ciphertext&quot;: b&#x27;\xencrypted...\data&#x27;,
    &quot;tag&quot;: b&#x27;\xauthentication-tag&#x27; # 16 bytes
}

Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3.

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input.

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

Here is an example:<br>  ```<br>  edit <br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br>  ---<br>  &lt;new_content&gt;<br>  ---<br>  ```<br><br>  The command will:<br>  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.<br>  Example: <br>  ```<br>  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input.

Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.<br>  Example: <br>  ```<br>  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

Here is an example:<br>  ```<br>  edit <br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br>  ---<br>  &lt;new_content&gt;<br>  ---<br>  ```<br><br>  The command will:<br>  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.<br>  Example: <br>  ```<br>  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

                Now that we have the reference implementation working, let&#x27;s optimize it. The key insight is that the input validation checks (key length and ciphertext length) are unnecessary since the problem guarantees valid inputs. Removing these checks will slightly improve performance.<br><br><pre><code class="language-python">edit

Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3.

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

Here is an example:<br>  ```<br>  edit <br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br>  ---<br>  &lt;new_content&gt;<br>  ---<br>  ```<br><br>  The command will:<br>  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.<br>  Example: <br>  ```<br>  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

Important: remember to include all arguments for each command.<br>Remember to sandwich your command in between ``` and ```. <br>IMPORTANT: Each set of triple backticks (```) must always be on their own line, without any other words or anything else on that line.<br><br>Here are the commands available to you. Ensure you include one and only one of the following commands in each of your responses:<br>- `edit`: Replace a range of lines with new content in a file. This is how you can create files: if the file does not exist, it will be created. Here is an example:<br>  ```<br>  edit <br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br>  ---<br>  &lt;new_content&gt;<br>  ---<br>  ```<br><br>  The command will:<br>  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input.

Here is an example:<br>  ```<br>  edit <br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br>  ---<br>  &lt;new_content&gt;<br>  ---<br>  ```<br><br>  The command will:<br>  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input.

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;<br>  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.<br>  Example: <br>  ```<br>  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions.

If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input.

If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  edit<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-7<br>  ---<br>  def improved_function():<br>      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)<br>  ---<br>- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.<br>- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).<br>- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.<br>- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: <br>  ```<br>  reference [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: <br>  ```<br>  eval_input [1,2,3,4]<br>  ```<br>- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.<br>- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: &lt;file_name&gt;<br>  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;<br><br>  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  delete<br>  file: solver.py<br>  lines: 5-10<br>  ```<br>- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.<br>  Example:<br>  ```<br>  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```<br>- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.<br>  Example: <br>  ```<br>  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]<br>  ```
