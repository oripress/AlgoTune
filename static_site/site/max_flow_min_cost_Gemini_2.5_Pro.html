YOUR TASK:
Your objective is to define a class named `Solver` in `solver.py` with a method:
```
class Solver:
    def solve(self, problem, **kwargs) -&gt; Any:
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Your implementation goes here.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        ...
```

IMPORTANT: Compilation time of your init function will not count towards your function&#x27;s runtime.

This `solve` function will be the entrypoint called by the evaluation harness. Strive to align your class and method implementation as closely as possible with the desired performance criteria.
For each instance, your function can run for at most 10x the reference runtime for that instance. Strive to have your implementation run as fast as possible, while returning the same output as the reference function (for the same given input). Be creative and optimize your approach!

Your messages should include a short thought about what you should do, followed by a _SINGLE_ command. The command must be enclosed within ``` and ```, like so:
&lt;Reasoning behind executing the command&gt;
```
&lt;command&gt;
```

IMPORTANT: Each set of triple backticks (```) must always be on their own line, without any other words or anything else on that line.

Here are the commands available to you. Ensure you include one and only one of the following commands in each of your responses:
- `edit`: Replace a range of lines with new content in a file. This is how you can create files: if the file does not exist, it will be created. Here is an example:
  ```
  edit 
  file: &lt;file_name&gt;
  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;
  ---
  &lt;new_content&gt;
  ---
  ```

  The command will:
  1. Delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)
  2. Insert &lt;new_content&gt; starting at &lt;start_line&gt;
  3. If both &lt;start_line&gt; and &lt;end_line&gt; are 0, &lt;new_content&gt; will be prepended to the file
  
  Example:
  edit
  file: solver.py
  lines: 5-7
  ---
  def improved_function():
      print(&quot;Optimized solution&quot;)
  ---
- `ls`: List all files in the current working directory.
- `view_file &lt;file_name&gt; [start_line]`: Display 100 lines of `&lt;file_name&gt;` starting from `start_line` (defaults to line 1).
- `revert`: Revert the code to the best-performing version thus far.
- `reference &lt;string&gt;`: Query the reference solver with a problem and receive its solution. If the problem&#x27;s input is a list, this command would look like: 
  ```
  reference [1,2,3,4]
  ```
- `eval_input &lt;string&gt;`: Run your current solver implementation on the given input. This is the only command that shows stdout from your solver along with both solutions. Example: 
  ```
  eval_input [1,2,3,4]
  ```
- `eval`: Run evaluation on the current solution and report the results.
- `delete`: Delete a range of lines from a file using the format:
  ```
  delete
  file: &lt;file_name&gt;
  lines: &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt;

  The command will delete the lines from &lt;start_line&gt; to &lt;end_line&gt; (inclusive)
  
  Example:
  delete
  file: solver.py
  lines: 5-10
  ```
- `profile &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profile your currently loaded solve method&#x27;s performance on a given input. Shows the 25 most time-consuming lines. Requires specifying a python file (e.g., `solver.py`) for validation, though profiling runs on the current in-memory code.
  Example:
  ```
  profile solver.py [1, 2, 3]
  ```

- `profile_lines &lt;filename.py&gt; &lt;line_number1, line_number2, ...&gt; &lt;input&gt;`: Profiles the chosen lines of the currently loaded code on the given input. Requires specifying a python file for validation.
  Example: 
  ```
  profile_lines solver.py 1,2,3 [1, 2, 3]
  ```

**TIPS:**
After each edit, a linter will automatically run to ensure code quality. If there are critical linter errors, your changes will not be applied, and you will receive the linter&#x27;s error message. Typically, linter errors arise from issues like improper indentation—ensure your edits maintain proper code formatting.
**Cython Compilation:** Edits creating or modifying Cython (`.pyx`) files will automatically trigger a compilation attempt (requires a `setup.py`). You will be notified if compilation succeeds or fails. If it fails, the edit to the `.pyx` file will be automatically reverted.
If the code runs successfully without errors, the in-memory &#x27;last known good code&#x27; will be updated to the new version. Following successful edits, you will receive a summary of your `solve` function&#x27;s performance compared to the reference.
If you get stuck, try reverting your code and restarting your train of thought.
Do not put an if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: block in your code, as it will not be ran (only the solve function will).
Keep trying to better your code until you run out of money. Do not stop beforehand!

**GOALS:**
Your primary objective is to optimize the `solve` function to run as as fast as possible, while returning the optimal solution.
You will receive better scores the quicker your solution runs, and you will be penalized for exceeding the time limit or returning non-optimal solutions.

Below you find the description of the task you will have to solve. Read it carefully and understand what the problem is and what your solver should do.

**TASK DESCRIPTION:**
Maximum Flow Min Cost Problem
Graph G is a directed graph with edge costs and capacities. There is a source node s and a sink node t. The task of Maximum Flow Min Cost Problem is to find a maximum flow from s to t whose total cost is minimized.

Input: A dictionary with 4 keys &quot;cost&quot; and &quot;capacity&quot; that contains the cost and capacity of each edge, and &quot;s&quot; &quot;t&quot; that determine the source and the sink. The cost and capacity are all non-negative and they are reprented by 2d array in Python. We require that if capacity[i][j] != 0, then capacity[j][i] must be 0.

Example input: {
    &quot;capacity&quot;=[
        [0, 10, 15, 20],
        [0, 0, 35, 25],
        [0, 0, 0, 30],
        [0, 0, 0, 0]
    ],
    &quot;cost&quot;=[
        [0, 1, 1, 2],
        [1, 0, 3, 2],
        [1, 3, 0, 3],
        [2, 2, 3, 0]
    ],
    &quot;s&quot;=0,
    &quot;t&quot;=3
}

Output: A 2d array that represent the flow on each edge.

Example output: [
        [0, 10, 15, 20],
        [0, 0, 0, 10],
        [0, 0, 0, 15],
        [0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

                I will start by implementing a solution using the `ortools` library, which is known for its high-performance optimization solvers. The reference solution uses `networkx`, which is often slower due to its pure Python implementation for many algorithms. The Maximum Flow Min Cost problem can be solved efficiently using specialized algorithms, and `ortools` provides a `SimpleMinCostFlow` solver that is likely implemented in C++.<br><br>My initial plan is to use the `SolveMaxFlowWithMinCost` method from the `ortools` solver. This method is designed for this exact problem, finding the maximum possible flow and ensuring that flow has the minimum cost.<br><br>A potential issue is that `ortools` solvers typically require integer inputs for capacities and costs, while the problem statement and validation function hint at the possibility of floating-point numbers. To handle this, I will scale the float inputs by a sufficiently large factor (e.g., 1,000,000) to convert them to integers, preserving precision. The validation tolerance is 1e-5, so a scaling factor of 1e6 should be adequate. After solving, I will scale the resulting flow values back down.<br><br>I will start by creating a `solver.py` file with this `ortools`-based approach.<br><br><pre><code class="language-python">edit

                The previous two-stage linear programming (LP) approach was correct but inefficient due to the overhead of creating and solving two separate optimization models. This resulted in a performance slightly worse than the baseline `networkx` solution.<br><br>To improve performance, I will switch to a more efficient single-LP formulation. This approach solves the lexicographical optimization problem (first maximize flow, then minimize cost) in one go by creating a composite objective function: `Maximize(M * Flow - Cost)`.<br><br>Here&#x27;s how it works:<br>1.  **Composite Objective**: The objective function combines flow and cost. `Flow` is multiplied by a very large constant `M`, while `Cost` is subtracted.<br>2.  **Choosing `M`**: The constant `M` must be large enough to ensure that maximizing flow is always prioritized over minimizing cost. A safe choice for `M` is a value larger than the maximum possible absolute total cost of any valid flow. I will calculate this as `M = 1.0 + sum(abs(cost_ij) * capacity_ij)` over all arcs.<br>3.  **Single Solver Pass**: This formulation allows the entire problem to be modeled and solved with a single call to the `ortools` LP solver (`GLOP`). This eliminates the overhead of the two-stage process, leading to a significant speedup.<br><br>This method leverages the high performance of the underlying C++ solver for a single, well-defined problem, which should be substantially faster than both the `networkx` baseline and my previous two-stage solution.<br><br><pre><code class="language-python">edit

                My previous LP-based solution was correct but not fast enough, as creating the LP model in Python incurs significant overhead.

                The `ModuleNotFoundError` indicates that the `SimpleMinCostFlow` solver is not available at the expected path in the execution environment. My attempts to find it, including dynamic imports, have failed.

My previous single-LP solution (1.45x speedup) was bottlenecked by the Python loops used to construct the optimization model. The nested loops iterating `n`x`n` times to build constraints and the objective function are inefficient, especially for graphs that are sparse (many zero-capacity edges).<br><br>To address this, I will implement a more efficient model construction:<br>1.  **Pre-build Adjacency Lists**: During the initial pass to create variables, I will simultaneously build `in_edges` and `out_edges` adjacency lists. This captures the graph&#x27;s structure efficiently.<br>2.  **Optimized Constraint Building**: I will use these adjacency lists to create the flow conservation constraints. Instead of iterating through all `n` nodes for each constraint, I will only iterate over the actual neighbors of a node, significantly reducing overhead for sparse graphs.<br>3.  **Optimized Objective Building**: The objective function will also be constructed using the adjacency lists and a single pass over the existing arcs (`x.items()`), avoiding the previous inefficient `n`x`n` loop.<br><br>This refined LP approach minimizes Python-side overhead, allowing the powerful `ortools` C++ solver to be leveraged more effectively.<br><br><pre><code class="language-python">edit

                The previous LP-based solutions, while correct, are fundamentally limited by the overhead of building the optimization model in Python.

I will scale the floating-point capacities and costs by `1,000,000` to convert them to integers while maintaining high precision.<br>3.  **Native Solving**: Once the model is built, a single call to `SolveMaxFlowWithMinCost` will execute a highly efficient native C++ algorithm (likely a capacity scaling push-relabel or cost-scaling algorithm), which should be orders of magnitude faster than the general-purpose LP solver.<br><br>This approach is the most direct path to top-tier performance by correctly identifying and working around the environmental constraint that previously blocked the use of the best available tool.<br><br><pre><code class="language-python">edit

                My attempts to locate the high-performance `SimpleMinCostFlow` solver have been unsuccessful, as the `pywrapgraph` module is not in the standard modern or legacy `ortools` paths. The fallback LP-based solutions are bottlenecked by the Python overhead of building the optimization model, which prevents them from reaching top-tier performance.<br><br>The only logical conclusion is that the specialized solver *is* available, but resides at a non-standard import path. My previous attempts were not exhaustive enough. In some custom environments or very old package versions, modules can be installed at the top level of the site-packages directory.<br><br>Therefore, my next attempt will be a more robust, multi-stage probing for the `pywrapgraph` module:<br>1.  **Three-Path Import**: I will use a nested `try-except` block to search for the module in three possible locations, in order of likelihood:<br>    a. Modern path: `ortools.graph.python.pywrapgraph`<br>    b. Legacy path: `ortools.graph.pywrapgraph`<br>    c. Top-level path: `pywrapgraph`<br>2.  **Native Solver Execution**: If any of these imports succeed, I will proceed with the `SimpleMinCostFlow` implementation. This approach uses a highly efficient native C++ algorithm, which avoids the Python model-building bottleneck entirely.<br>3.  **Integer Scaling**: The solver requires integer inputs, so I will continue to use the proven technique of scaling the float capacities and costs by a large factor (`1,000,000`) to maintain precision.<br><br>This strategy directly confronts the environmental uncertainty that has been the primary obstacle and represents the most likely path to the significant speedup required to be competitive.<br><br><pre><code class="language-python">edit

                My attempts to use the specialized `SimpleMinCostFlow` solver have failed, confirming it is unavailable. The path forward is to perfect the linear programming (LP) solution.<br><br>My best performance (1.55x speedup) came from an LP model using the `GLOP` solver. However, its objective function construction was inefficient, using `GetCoefficient` in a loop. My subsequent attempts to optimize this construction paradoxically resulted in a lower speedup (1.46x), even with a theoretically faster single-pass objective loop.<br><br>This suggests a subtle interaction with the `ortools` C++ backend. The structure of the 1.55x solution was effective, but its implementation was slow. I will now implement a solution that keeps the successful structure but radically optimizes its implementation.<br><br>My strategy is as follows:<br>1.  **Retain the Core Structure**: I will use the `GLOP` solver and the efficient model-building techniques (pre-built `arcs` and adjacency lists) that have proven effective.<br>2.  **Two-Stage Objective Construction**: I will build the objective function in two distinct stages to completely eliminate the expensive `GetCoefficient` calls from my best-performing solution.<br>    *   **Stage 1 (Cost Minimization)**: First, I will iterate through all arcs and set their objective coefficient to `-cost[i][j]`. This sets up the cost minimization part of the objective.<br>    *   **Stage 2 (Flow Maximization)**: Second, I will iterate *only* over the arcs connected to the source `s`. For these specific arcs, I will *overwrite* their existing coefficient, adding the large `M` component. For an arc `(s, j)`, the new coefficient becomes `-cost[s][j] + M`.<br><br>This two-stage process is mathematically identical to my previous composite objective but is implemented far more efficiently. It avoids both the `GetCoefficient` calls of the 1.55x solution and the single-loop `if/else` logic of the 1.46x solution, providing a new, highly optimized path that may overcome the subtle performance issues previously encountered.<br><br><pre><code class="language-python">edit

                My attempts to optimize a single-LP solution have hit a performance ceiling around 1.48x, failing to surpass the 1.55x speedup of an earlier, two-stage LP solution.

                After numerous attempts to optimize a linear programming (LP) solution, I have concluded that the performance bottleneck is not just the Python model-building overhead, but also the choice of the underlying solver algorithm.
