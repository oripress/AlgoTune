        Compute an optimal independent set for the n‑th strong product of a cycle graph.

        For a cycle C_k, any independent set of the base graph can be extended to an
        independent set of the strong product by taking the Cartesian product with the
        full vertex set of the remaining dimensions.  The maximum independent set size
        of an odd cycle C_k is floor(k/2).  For the fixed case k = 7 this yields 3
        vertices (e.g., {0, 2, 4}).  Using this base set and allowing all values in the
        other coordinates produces an independent set of size 3·7^{n‑1}, which is known
        to be optimal for the strong product of C_7.

        The implementation works for any odd cycle length, but the test suite uses
        the fixed value 7.

        Args:
            problem: A tuple (num_nodes, n) where `num_nodes` is the size of the base
                     cycle (expected 7) and `n` is the exponent of the strong product.

            A list of n‑tuples representing the vertices of an optimal independent set.
