        Solves the power control problem using a fast iterative algorithm.

        This problem is a standard form of power control in wireless networks,
        which can be formulated as a Linear Program (LP). The optimal solution
        (minimizing total power) is the component-wise smallest power vector P
        that satisfies the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR)
        and power limit constraints.

        This minimal vector can be found efficiently using a fixed-point iteration
        based on the standard interference function. This approach is typically
        much faster than using a general-purpose LP solver, as it consists of
        simple, vectorizable NumPy operations.

        The iteration is:
        P(t+1) = clip(f(P(t)), P_min, P_max)
        where f_i(P) = S_min/G_ii * (sigma_i + sum_{k!=i} G_ik * P_k)

        The algorithm starts with the lowest possible power P(0) = P_min and
        iteratively increases powers until all SINR constraints are met.
        Convergence is guaranteed because the update function is monotonic and
        the power values are bounded.
