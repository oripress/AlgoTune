        Solves the sparse matrix exponential problem by computing exp(A).
        This solver handles a specific incompatibility with the pydata/sparse
        library. It uses `isinstance` to check if the input matrix is of a
        type that `scipy.expm` handles natively (scipy.sparse.spmatrix or
        numpy.ndarray). If not, it assumes the matrix is a pydata/sparse
        object and converts it to a compatible scipy.sparse matrix before
        computation.
