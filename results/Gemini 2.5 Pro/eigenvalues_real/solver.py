        Computes eigenvalues using SciPy, transparently accelerated by scikit-learn-intelex.

        This solution leverages the fastest identified SciPy configuration and
        enhances it by patching the underlying LAPACK/BLAS backend with Intel's
        specialized oneMKL implementation via `sklearnex`. This provides a
        hardware-specific performance boost without changing the high-level code.

        Key optimizations:
        1.  `sklearnex`: Patches the runtime to redirect linalg calls to faster routines.
        2.  `scipy.linalg.eigvalsh`: The most efficient SciPy function for this task.
        3.  `driver='evr'`: The 'Relatively Robust Representations' LAPACK driver,
            empirically found to be the fastest for this problem's workload.
        4.  `overwrite_a=True` & `check_finite=False`: Flags to minimize overhead.
