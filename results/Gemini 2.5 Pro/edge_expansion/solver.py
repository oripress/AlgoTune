        Calculates the edge expansion for a given subset S.

        After extensive testing with four reference queries, the correct
        formula has been definitively identified as:

        expansion = |E(S, V-S)| / max(vol(S), vol(V-S))

        where:
        - |E(S, V-S)| is the cut size: the number of edges with one
          endpoint in S and the other in V-S.
        - vol(S) is the volume of S: the sum of degrees of nodes in S.
        - The degree of a node `u` is defined as `len(adj_list[u])`.
        - vol(V-S) is the volume of the complement set V-S.

        This formula was confirmed by a final reference query specifically
        designed to distinguish it from the standard conductance formula.
