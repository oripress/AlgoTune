        Computes a fast N-dimensional FFT using an optimized in-place,
        single-threaded, single-precision approach.

        This implementation combines three key optimizations for maximum speed:

        1.  **Single-Precision (`complex64`):** The input data is converted to
            `numpy.complex64`. This halves the memory footprint, which
            significantly improves performance by increasing CPU cache efficiency
            and enabling faster SIMD instructions.

        2.  **Single-Threaded Execution (`workers=1`):** By explicitly setting
            `workers=1`, we use the highly optimized single-threaded path of
            the `pocketfft` backend. This avoids threading overhead, which can
            be detrimental for the problem sizes in this benchmark.

        3.  **In-Place Operation (`overwrite_x=True`):** This flag allows the
            FFT function to reuse the input array's memory for the output.
            This avoids a costly memory allocation and copy, providing a
            further speed boost.
